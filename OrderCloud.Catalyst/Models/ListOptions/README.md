## List Options and Proxying OrderCloud

Sometimes OrderCloud's permission model may not be able to handle your use case. As a work around, consider requesting ordercloud with elevated permissions in the secure context of your own proxy api and writing server-side code to enforce your permission rules. This pattern can help in many situations. For example, coverting the currency of product prices or letting franchise owners see their employee's orders. Here is [example code](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/dotnet-middleware/blob/dev/Customer.OrderCloud.Api/Controllers/ProxyListOrdersController.cs) powered by the Catalyst library for how to proxy an OrderCloud list call. List calls are more complex than other operation because of list arguments like search and filters. See [Advanced Querying](https://ordercloud.io/features/advanced-querying) for a refresher on list arguments in OrderCloud.
